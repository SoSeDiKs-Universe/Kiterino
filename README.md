  ## Kiterino üêÆ

  Kiterino is a [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) fork maintained specifically for [SoSeDiK's Universe](https://sosedik.com).

  It contains different questionable experimental APIs that should not be used normally.
  
  There are also hardcoded vanilla mechanics changes that were considered suitable for our server.
